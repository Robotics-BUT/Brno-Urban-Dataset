# Brno-Urban-Dataset
Navigation and localisation dataset for self driving cars and autonomous robots

Our entire dataset is highly inspired by the Oxford dataset [8], which currently defines publicly available state-of-the-art background for developing and testing autonomous algorithms for self-driving cars [11]. In spite of high quality of this project, the data has been recorded in 2014 with sensors that has been commonly available at that time. Since that, we have higher resolution cameras, 3D LIDARs became a standard and inertial units have lower noise now. We believe that data we have recorded, and which we are making public can complement this quality gap and make possible to develop new edge breaking technologies.

The biggest part of our dataset has been recorded in Brno in area of BUT campus at the north of the city and in near neighbourhood. As this area is placed at the suburb of the second largest city in Czech Republic with more than 400 000 citizens, it gives possibility to record traffic rush situations, highways, tunnels, empty streets, narrow alleys as well as field roads, woods, countryside or the airport, all at very small area.
